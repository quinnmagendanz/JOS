1) MPBOOTPHYS is necessary to calculate absolute addresses of its symbols since there is no linker to do it.

2) The big kernel lock prevents a CPU from overriding another CPU's objects which it is currently operating or relies on. Even with the protection of a kernel lock, another CPU could mess up the kernel stack or memory in the kernel space, affecting other CPUs.

3) Pointer e must point to an address in the kernel space since the kernel space is the same on every stack.

4) This happens by pushing the registers to the top of the stack. This way, each env must only remember the location of its stack.
