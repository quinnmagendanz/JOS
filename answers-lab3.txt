1) We have an individual handler for each function so that we can specifically identify when we expect the CPU to push error codes onto the stack. In cases we know it will not, we must push a zero on the stack so that a user cannot push something to the stack, trying to play it off as a CPU code.

2) We want user space to trap 13, not 14 so that the handling for 14 can be at kernel priviledge level, and not accidentally give kernel access to a user who calls it.
